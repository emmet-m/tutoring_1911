# tutoring\_1911
Tutoring repo for COMP1911

## How to use this repository

Each folder contains the relevant week's excersizes! You can download the entire repository via the green "Clone or Download" button. Click it and select "Download ZIP" to download a zip file of everything. You can unzip this file on CSE with the command `unzip tutoring_1911.zip` on the command line.

## Where are the questions for each code file???

You can find them on [WEBCMS3](https://webcms3.cse.unsw.edu.au/COMP1911/18s1/resources/14285).

## This program doesn't work! There are some programs missing!

Not all the programs are finished! Some are broken purely to demonstrate a concept (e.g. infinity.c in week 4).

Want working copies of broken programs here? Try and fix them yourself! :)

If you want the full solutions, check WEBCMS3 later on when Angela posts official solutions. The purpose of these programs is so you have a copy of what we did in class! :)
